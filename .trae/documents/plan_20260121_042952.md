I will optimize the project structure and code logic according to your requirements.

### 1. Cleanup Redundant Files
I will delete the following files that appear to be temporary, backup, or debug scripts to keep the project clean:
- `1_backup.py` (Backup file)
- `2.py`, `use.py` (Temporary test scripts)
- `debug_*.py` (Debug scripts)
- `create_test_image.py`, `test_client.py` (Test utilities)
- `output.log` (Log file)
- `test_doc.png` (Root directory test file)

### 2. Refactor Core Code (`1.py`)
I will thoroughly refactor `1.py` to ensure it is robust, readable, and user-friendly:
- **Architecture**: Separate logic into clear classes (`OCREngine`, `Translator`, `PDFRenderer`, `FileManager`).
- **Logic Enhancements**:
  - Improve compatibility with PaddleOCR return formats (handling both V3 and legacy).
  - Add robustness for PDF inputs (ensuring it doesn't crash on multi-page results, defaulting to the first page for this version).
- **UI/UX Improvements**:
  - Update the embedded HTML/CSS to a modern, concise, and beautiful interface.
  - Enhance visual feedback during processing (upload -> analyze -> translate -> generate).
- **Comments**: Add function-level comments (docstrings) explaining inputs and outputs.

### 3. Documentation
- Keep `README_WEB.md` as the main entry point.
- Keep `开始使用.md` and `服务化部署.md` as reference documentation.

I will start by cleaning up the files and then rewriting `1.py`.
